When running web-spa in server mode, by issuing the command:

	'java -jar web-spa-x.x.jar -server'

A number of files get created in the current directory. One
of these files is the configuration file, named:

	'web-spa-config.properties'
	
This file contains two (2) very important properties:

1. access-log-file-location
2. logging-regex-for-each-request

1. The access-log-file-location property is the location within
the filesystem where the access log file of the web server is.

This has a default value:
	'/var/log/apache2/access.log'
	
Which can be modified before starting web-spa in server mode.

2. The logging-regex-for-each-request property is the regular
expression indicating where within each line of the access log
file the timestamp and part of the URL are located.

This has a default value:
	'\\[(\\d{2}/\\w{3}/\\d{4}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2} .....)\\] \"GET /(\\S*) HTTP\\/1\\.'

Which can also be modified before starting web-spa in server 
mode.
